    About Jamie
</h1>
  <p>
      Hello, I'm Jamie, and in this picture is my girlfriend
      of over two years.
  </p>
  <p>
      My two absolute favorite hobbies are hiking and video games,
      but I can now add coding to the list!
  </p>
  <p>
      I have a cat that i rescued as a kitten about five years ago named Tuff.
